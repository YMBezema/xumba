**XdY+n**: This formula signifies rolling the appropriate dice and adding a number. 2d6+6 means roll two six-sided dice and add six to the result.
## Dice Used In The Game

Mythras uses the standard range of roleplaying polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Additionally, the game calls for the use of a d2 and d3: d2: Roll any die. An odds number equals 1 and evens equals 2. Or flip a coin. d3: Roll a six-sided die; 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3.

For 1d100, take a pair of d10 and decide which one will be the 10s and which the units. The result is a number between 01 and 00 (100). This is sometimes known as 'd%'.

Each die has its own uses. D100 is most frequently used for skill rolls. D20 is used for identifying a location struck during combat. The others are used in different combinations generally for weapon damage and injuries.

All the dice used can be bought from good game stores, and online, in sets or individually.
## Rounding Of Numbers And Results

On some occasions you will be required to divide numbers - typically the rating in a skill (such as for determining a critical success, which is 1/10th of the skill's value). Whenever a division result creates a fraction, always round up to the whole number. So, for instance, 1/10th of 64% is 6.4; this is rounded up to 7.
