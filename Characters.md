#### Designing A Character
Characters are usually recorded on a character sheet, which is a handy way of organizing all the information about the character. 
#### Character Concept
~~A good place to start is to have some idea of what sort of character you want to play; a hardened warrior for example, or a cunning thief. Your character concept does not need to be elaborate at this stage; simply an idea that will help guide certain choices such as race and profession. A few character ideas are listed to provoke your imagination.~~
## Characteristics
Every sapient creature is defined by seven characteristics. Each characteristic tells you something about your character; how strong or fast he or she is; how clever or healthy. Characteristics are at the core of every Mythras character, and form the basis for most of the other elements such as Attributes and Skills. The seven characteristics are:

- Strength (STR)
- Constitution (CON)
- Size (SIZ)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Power (POW)
- Charisma (CHA)

Before calculating the characteristics, the following section explains what each represents.

### Strength (Str)
STR represents physical strength: how much one can lift, how hard one can hit, and so on. Characters with a high STR are likely to be more heavily muscled whilst those with a low STR are somewhat on the scrawny side. STR is a component of the Damage Modifier (see page ??). If a character is reduced to zero STR he lacks the ability to move or lift objects, becoming bedridden until STR improves somehow (through natural healing or magic, for example).

### Constitution (Con)
CON is a measure of health and hardiness. Those with a high CON are physically tough, and likely to be more resistant to disease or poison. Those with a low CON are less resilient, and may be prone to sickness and tire quickly. CON is a component in determining Hit Points (see page ??), and Healing Rate (see page ??). If CON falls to zero for any reason the character dies.

### Size (Siz)
SIZ measures mass and helps indicate height and weight. The larger the SIZ the heavier or bigger the creature is likely to be. Most creatures' SIZ has a higher minimum value than other characteristics, representing the smallest example of an adult of that race; which in the case of humans is 8. SIZ is used to help figure Hit Points (see page ??), as larger, heavier creatures tend to have greater endurance against damage. SIZ can also be used to determine a character's Damage Modifier, since mass helps to increase the force of a blow. SIZ provides rough limits to Height and Weight, depending on the character's body frame (see page ??). If SIZ drops below the species minimum they are considered to have wasted away to the point they are bedridden.

### Dexterity (Dex)
Agility, balance, and reflexes are measured by DEX. Characters with high DEX are fast, nimble, and graceful of movement. Those with a low DEX tend to be lumbering and clumsy. DEX is an important aspect of Action Points (see page ??), and Initiative Bonus (see page ??). If a character is reduced to zero DEX they suffer functional paralysis, unable to move until the situation is rectified.

### Intelligence (Int)
INT is a measurement of cognitive ability. It indicates the capacity for a character to think both logically and creatively. Those with a lower INT score are not necessarily stupid, but they are likely to be constrained in how creatively they can employ their wits. Creatures with an INT of 7 or below are considered sentient, retaining animal level instinct, and able to react to stimuli. Individuals with an INT of 8 or higher are deemed fully sapient. INT is a factor in calculating Action Points (see page ??), and Initiative Bonus (see page ??). If INT is reduced to zero the character becomes completely mindless.

### Power (Pow)
Power is a measurement of a character's soul, spirit, inner drive, and capacity for magic. It encompasses a number of different things and is a relatively abstract measurement, but is also one of the most important. POW is the characteristic that marks a character out to the gods or other supernatural powers, and is an indication of divine or magical potential, as well as being an indication of the force of their personal determination. POW governs a character's Magic Points (see page ??), and Luck Points (see page ??). If a character's POW ever drops to zero they lose all independent will.

### Charisma (Cha)
Charisma measures personality, and is independent of physical appearance. Someone with a high CHA for example, might be ugly or plain to look at, but blessed with a charm and wit that more than compensates for not being handsome. Likewise a low CHA might indicate someone who is radiantly beautiful but utterly shallow or simply meek. A good CHA is often useful for those who wish to be leaders or centres of their local community. Diehard loners and submissive followers tend towards the other extreme. CHA affects a character's Experience Modifier (see page ??). If CHA is ever falls to zero, the character can no longer socially interact with others, becoming so painfully shy or antisocial they are ignored or even driven away.

## Calculating Characteristics
Each characteristic has a numerical value to determine how potent it is. Characteristic values can be calculated in one of several ways; either by random dice rolls or by allocating a predetermined number of points. Which method to be used is governed by the Games Master.

## Attributes
Each character also has a set of attributes. These are particular capabilities derived from the characteristics, or determined by them that are used to govern certain factors of game play. The attributes are:

- Action Points
- Damage Modifier
- Experience Modifier
- Healing Rate
- Height and Weight
- Hit Points
- Initiative Bonus
- Luck Points
- Magic Points
- Movement Rate

### Action Points
How often a character can act in a combat round (see the Combat chapter) is determined by Action Points. How they are used is discussed in more detail on page ??, but to determine a character's base number of Action Points take the sum of INT and DEX, and consult the chart below: 

| INT + DEX                      | Action Points |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 12 or Less                     | 1             |
| 13–24                          | 2             |
| 25–36                          | 3             |
| For every additional 12 points | +1            |
***The Reasons Why…***
- *INT: Clever characters can more easily exploit openings and opportunities* that lend them an edge in combat
- *DEX: Agile characters react more quickly, and can therefore act more often during combat*
### Damage Modifier

The bonus amount of damage a character inflicts when they physically strike or apply force. It is generally used in combat situations, but can also be utilized when attempting to break objects. The damage modifier is an extra die roll which is either added to or subtracted from the damage inflicted by the weapon or tool. If a negative damage modifier takes a weapon's damage to zero or below, then no damage at all has been inflicted.

Add together STR and SIZ, and consult the Damage Modifier table:

| STR + SIZ        | Damage Modifier        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5 *or Less*      | –1d8                   |
| 6–10             | –1d6                   |
| 11–15            | –1d4                   |
| 16–20            | –1d2                   |
| 21–25            | +0                     |
| 26–30            | +1d2                   |
| 31–35            | +1d4                   |
| 36–40            | +1d6                   |
| 41–45            | +1d8                   |
| 46–50            | +1d10                  |
| 51–60            | +1d12                  |
| 61–70            | +2d6                   |
| 71–80            | +1d8+1d6               |
| 81–90            | +2d8                   |
| 91–100           | +1d10+1d8              |
| 101-110          | +2d10                  |
| 111-120          | +2d10+1d2              |
| 121-130          | +2d10+1d4              |
| *Each 10 points* | *Continue Progression* |
***The reasons why***
- *STR: Stronger characters can apply more brute force*
- *SIZ: Greater size usually indicates greater mass or leverage*

### Experience Modifier
Over the course of play, characters improve their skills and capabilities. This is achieved through the use of Experience Rolls which are explained in more detail on page ??. 

A character's CHA score may adjust the number of Experience Rolls the character has, reflecting the relationship they have with their peers, and their reputation in their community. If CHA is high, people are willing to put themselves out to help train or support the character while they undergo tuition. Conversely, if CHA is particularly low, there may be some difficulty improving one's capabilities without the assistance of others; finding someone to spar against, for example.

| CHA             | Experience Modifier |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| 6 *or Less*     | –1                  |
| 7–12            | 0                   |
| 13–18           | +1                  |
| *Each 6 points* | +1                  |
***The reasons why***
- *CHA: Charismatic characters possess greater force of personality and the ability to encourage cooperation from friends, comrades, and peers*

### Healing Rate

After receiving injuries, a character needs to recuperate. Healing Rate determines how quickly they naturally recover from wounds. Depending on the severity of the injury (see page ??), the Healing Rate denotes how many Hit Points are recovered per day, week, or month. 

| CON             | Healing Rate |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 6 *or Less*     | 1            |
| 7–12            | 2            |
| 13–18           | 3            |
| *Each 6 points* | +1           |

### Height And Weight
A character's height and weight depend on two things: SIZ and the character's body frame. Three body frames are provided; lithe (slender, athletic, underweight), medium, and heavy (broad-shouldered, barrel-chested, overweight). Players are free to pick their preferred frame depending on how they envisage the character. If non-humans are being created, race may limit the choice of body frame.

To calculate height and weight, which is measured in centimeters and kilos, cross-reference SIZ with the body frame selected. The result is a range of values that your character's height and weight fall into. You should choose the actual value from within this range.

The Height and Weight table can, of course, be used to determine the physical properties of anything, but is primarily designed to reflect humanoids. Other creatures, however, can have more extreme body frames beyond those given here. See the Creatures chapter, page ??.

| SIZ          | Height (cm) | Lithe (Kg) | Medium (Kg) | Heavy (Kg) |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1            | 1-45        | 1-5        | 1-7         | 1-9        |
| 2            | 46-80       | 6-10       | 8-14        | 10-18      |
| 3            | 81-105      | 11-15      | 15-21       | 19-27      |
| 4            | 106-120     | 16-20      | 22-28       | 28-36      |
| 5            | 121-130     | 21-25      | 29-35       | 37-45      |
| 6            | 131-140     | 26-30      | 36-42       | 46-54      |
| 7            | 141-150     | 31-35      | 43-49       | 55-63      |
| 8            | 151-155     | 36-40      | 50-56       | 64-72      |
| 9            | 156-160     | 41-45      | 57-63       | 73-81      |
| 10           | 161-165     | 46-50      | 64-70       | 82-90      |
| 11           | 166-170     | 51-55      | 71-77       | 91-99      |
| 12           | 171-175     | 56-60      | 78-84       | 100-108    |
| 13           | 176-180     | 61-65      | 85-91       | 109-117    |
| 14           | 181-185     | 66-70      | 92-98       | 118-126    |
| 15           | 186-190     | 71-75      | 99-105      | 127-135    |
| 16           | 191-195     | 76-80      | 106-112     | 136-144    |
| 17           | 196-200     | 81-85      | 113-119     | 145-153    |
| 18           | 201-205     | 86-90      | 120-126     | 154-162    |
| 19           | 206-210     | 91-95      | 127-133     | 163-171    |
| 20           | 211-215     | 96-100     | 134-140     | 172-180    |
| 21           | 216-220     | 101-105    | 141-147     | 181-189    |
| *Each point* | +5 cm       | +5 Kg      | +7 Kg       | +9 Kg      |
### Hit Points
Hit Points represent how much injury an area of the body can withstand before it becomes useless, possibly resulting in incapacitation, and ultimately the character's death. The body of every creature is divided into separate locations - humans, for example, have seven; the head, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs - each location with its own hit points.

Some creatures, such as monsters or different classes of animal, by their very nature often have radically different body structures, yet each location they possess still has Hit Points. When a location's hit points are reduced to a certain level through damage of any kind, then the character suffers certain consequences that reflect the severity of the injury. For further information concerning wounds see page ??.

To calculate the Hit Points of each location, add CON and SIZ together and cross-reference on the Hit Points table.

**Hit Points Per Location (CON+SIZ)**:

| Location | 1–5 | 6–10 | 11–15 | 16–20 | 21–25 | 26–30 | 31–35 | 36–40 | +5 pts |
| -------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Leg      | 1   | 2    | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | +1     |
| Abdomen  | 2   | 3    | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | +1     |
| Chest    | 3   | 4    | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | +1     |
| Each Arm | 1   | 1    | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | +1     |
| Head     | 1   | 2    | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | +1     |
***The reasons why***
- *CON: Healthy, resilient individuals can withstand more punishment than frailer ones*
- *SIZ: Greater bulk helps absorb damage, and reduce the significance of an injury*

### Initiative Bonus
The moment at which someone reacts in combat is governed by initiative. Initiative Bonus acts as a modifier to initiative rolls; the higher the bonus, the faster one responds in a combat situation, determining when you can act. Further factors - armour for example - modify it. The Combat chapter goes into more detail on how Initiative works (see page ??).

Initiative Bonus is the average of the DEX and INT characteristics.

***The reasons why***

- *INT: Clever fighters can predict attacks and anticipate their opponent's strategies*
- *DEX: Faster characters react and respond more quickly than slower ones*

### Luck Points
Luck Points represent that strange force differentiating adventuring heroes from everyday folk. Call it fate, karma or simple good fortune. Luck Points can be used to:

- Re-roll the dice, if they are unfavourable
- Mitigate physical damage or other unfortunate circumstances
- Gain an edge at a vital moment in combat

Exactly how they are used, and when, is described on page ??. 

Once a Luck Point is spent, the pool decreases; when one is out of Luck Points, no more are available - unless the Games Master makes an impromptu award - until the next game session when they replenish to their normal value.

| POW           | Luck Points   |
|---------------|---------------|
| 6 or Less     | 1             |
| 7–12          | 2             |
| 13–18         | 3             |
| Each 6 points | +1            |
***The reasons why***
- *POW: Power is a measure of luck and divine favour; a gift of fate, or the ability to cheat it*

### Magic Points
#removed

~~Mystical abilities and spells cast in Mythras usually rely on Magic Points. Since the availability of magic may be limited by a campaign setting or to specific magical professions, some characters will find this Attribute superfluous.~~

~~For those who can utilize such powers, a character's Magic Points are equal to their POW. These points are used to cast spells, the cost of which is dependent on the type of magic used. When the caster runs out of Magic Points he has exhausted his ability to cast any spells until they are replenished.~~

***The reasons why***
- ~~*POW: Power is a measure of both willpower - used to command the magical fabric - and the psychic strength the character channels from their environment*~~

## Movement Rate

Movement is not calculated from Characteristics but is a default value which differs between species. The base Movement Rate for humans is 6 metres, although certain skills can improve this. The section on Movement, on page ??, offers more detail.
